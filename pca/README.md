<h1>Principal Component Analysis</h1>
<h2>Datasets and Instructions:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>MNIST dataset has been downloaded from Kaggle. Download it, and for the sake of clarity, ensure that the name of the directory is <i>'mnist'</i>. Furthermore, note that the mnist directory must contain two .csv files for the code to function properly. If you have downloaded the mnist dataset from some other source, then change the code accordingly.</li>
  <li>Cats and Dogs dataset has been downloaded from Microsoft, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765">here</a>. Download the dataset (rename it to <i>'catsdogs'</i>) and put in the same folder as that of this Jupyter Notebook. Create the following additional directories, alongside the 'catsdogs':
  <ul>
    <li>black_white_dog</li>
    <li>black_white_cat</li>
    <li>cropped_dog</li>
    <li>cropped_cat</li>
    <li>incorrect_images</li>
  </ul><b>Note:</b> If you are facing trouble with directory structure, then please refer to the code. More specifically have a look at the function <b>read_cats_dogs_dataset()</b>.</li>
</ul>
